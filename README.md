### Note for Reviewer:

I understand that I am uploading this project late due to my exams. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to set up the repository, demo URL, or other details. I hope this will not be an issue. For verification, feel free to DM me on Slack, and I can share my exam timetable as proof.
